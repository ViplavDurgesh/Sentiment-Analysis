Step 1: Data Loading and Splitting 

    •	The code loads a CSV dataset (Data.csv) containing financial news headlines and their corresponding dates.
    
    •	It splits the dataset into training (train) and testing (test) sets based on specific date ranges.

Step 2: Text Preprocessing

    •	Punctuation is removed from the news headlines to clean the text for analysis.
    
    •	Column names are updated for easier access and readability.


Step 3: Text Normalization and Data Transformation

    •	All headlines are converted to lowercase to ensure uniformity in text processing.
    
    •	Headlines from each row in the training dataset are concatenated into a single string and stored in a new column ('headlines').

Step 4: Feature Extraction with Bag of Words (Count Vectorizer)

    •	Count Vectorizer Initialization: Prepares the Count Vectorizer object with an ngram_range= (2,2), 
      which specifies that only bi-grams (pairs of adjacent words) are considered.
      This step converts text data into numerical feature vectors suitable for machine learning algorithms.
      
    •	Training Data Transformation: Applies the Count Vectorizer to transform the concatenated headlines from the training set (train)
      into a matrix of token counts (train_dataset_cv).

Step 5: Model Training

    •	Random Forest Classifier Initialization: Sets up a Random Forest Classifier with n_estimators=200 (200 decision trees) 
      and uses criterion='entropy' for splitting nodes based on information gain.
      
    •	Fitting the Model: Trains the Random Forest Classifier on the transformed training data (train_dataset_cv) with the target variable (train['Label']),
      which likely indicates the predicted movement of stock prices (increase or decrease). 
    
Note: Alongside Random Forest Classifier I trained this model by other supervised ML technique like Logistic regression, K-Nearest Neigbour and SVM.

Step 6: Model Evaluation

    •	Prediction: Uses the trained Random Forest Classifier to predict stock price movement labels for the test dataset (predictions_rf_cv).
    
    •	Performance Metrics: Computes several metrics to evaluate the model's performance:
    
        o	Confusion Matrix (matrix_rf_cv): Summarizes the number of correct and incorrect predictions.
        
        o	Accuracy Score (score_rf_cv): Calculates the proportion of correct predictions.
        
        o	Classification Report (report_rf_cv): Provides precision, recall, F1-score, and support for each class.

Step 7: ROC Curve and AUC Calculation

    •	Probability Prediction: Computes the probability predictions (probabilities_rf_cv) of the positive class (likely stock price increase).
    
    •	ROC Curve Generation: Plots the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve using matplotlib,
    
        showing the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
        
    •	ROC AUC Score: Calculates the Area Under Curve (AUC) score to quantify the model's ability to distinguish between positive and negative classes
        based on the predicted probabilities.

Interpretation

    •	Sharpe Ratio
    
        o	A higher Sharpe Ratio indicates better risk-adjusted returns.
        
        o	In this calculation, the Sharpe Ratio is dependent on the excess returns and their standard deviation over the period considered.
        
        o	If the Sharpe Ratio is significantly higher than 1, it indicates that the investment has performed well on a risk-adjusted basis.
            If it is close to or below 1, it indicates average or poor performance.
            
•	Maximum Drawdown

        o	A lower (more negative) maximum drawdown indicates higher historical risk and potential loss.
        
        o	If the Maximum Drawdown is a large negative value, it indicates that the investment has experienced significant declines in the past,
            suggesting higher risk. A smaller drawdown would indicate a more stable investment.

Conclusion

  •	Sharpe Ratio: The investment's performance relative to its risk can be evaluated.
    A high Sharpe Ratio suggests that the returns are favourable compared to the volatility.
    
  •	Maximum Drawdown: Provides insight into the worst-case scenario regarding loss from peak to trough.
    A lower maximum drawdown suggests better risk management and stability.
  
To conclude, these metrics together give a holistic view of the investment's performance, balancing both return and risk. 
They help investors understand not only how much return they might expect but also how much risk they are taking on to achieve those returns.
